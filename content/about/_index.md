# 🏃 Running  


Running has recently become one of my favorite hobbies. I believe it’s one of the most **challenging** sports.  
Although it’s easy to start—requiring no equipment or coaching—it demands strong **motivation**, **patience**, and **discipline**.  

Running helps me **relieve stress** and gives me a chance to explore the ✨ _beauty of the city_.

I volunteer as a **Media Leader** at *VietFest*, where I’m responsible for managing all our social media platforms.  
Our mission is to promote and preserve Vietnamese cultural values for those living in Adelaide.  

I love this work because I feel I’m **contributing** to keeping our **rich and diverse culture** alive while living abroad. 🌏

# ⚗️ Chemistry  
Chemistry was my **major in high school**, chosen out of a love for how substances interact — sometimes with each other, sometimes with light or heat.  

I was selected to join the **Chemistry training team** at both the school and provincial levels. 🧪🧬

# 🎞️ Editing  
I picked up editing **by chance** after joining a club in high school.  
I learned the fundamentals of photo and video editing, which turned out to be super useful at university.  

Now I use these skills to **polish my presentations** and **assignments**. 🎓✨

# 🏐 Volleyball  
Volleyball has been one of my favorite sports since junior high school, taught by my aunt.  

At first, it was difficult — you have to coordinate with your teammates and stay focused at all times.  
Eventually, I joined my school’s volleyball team and **competed** with other schools. 🏆
